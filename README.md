## PES ASIC CLASS
## DAY1
Basic Definition: An Instruction Set Architecture (ISA) is part of the abstract model of a computer that defines how the CPU is controlled by the software. The ISA acts as an interface between the hardware and the software, specifying both what the processor is capable of doing as well as how it gets done.
RISC-V is an open-source instruction set architecture used to develop custom processors for a variety of applications, from embedded designs to supercomputers. From Apps to Hardware
Applications: Applications, also known as software applications or simply apps, are programs or software designed to perform specific tasks or functions for end-users. Examples include word processors, web browsers, and games
System Software: System software refers to a collection of programs and utilities that manage and control a computer system's hardware and provide services to other software applications. It includes the operating system, device drivers, and system utilities.
Compiler: A compiler is a software tool that translates high-level programming code (source code) written by humans into machine code or intermediate code that can be executed directly by a computer's hardware or by a virtual machine.
Assembler: An assembler is a program or tool that translates assembly language code, a low-level human-readable representation of machine code instructions, into machine code that can be executed by a computer's CPU.
RTL (Register-Transfer Level): RTL, or Register-Transfer Level, is a level of hardware description language used to model the behavior of digital circuits at a low level of abstraction. It specifies how data moves between registers and how logic operations are performed.
Hardware: Hardware refers to the physical components of a computer system, including the CPU, memory, storage devices, input/output devices, and other electronic and mechanical components. It is the tangible, physical part of a computer system

Using the RISC-V GCC compiler, we compiled the C program. riscv64-unknown-elf-gcc -O1 -mabi=lp64 -march=rv64i -o p1.o p1.c Using ls -ltr p1.c we can check that the object file is created.

the byte information increments by 4 bytes,
number of instructions =1084/4

Spike Simulation and Debug: spike pk p1.o is used to check whether the instructions produced are right to give the correct output.
spike -d pk p1.c is used for debugging.

Application binary interface(ABI)
ABI (application binary interface), as the name says, is an interface, that helps programs access system hardware and services.
ABI defines how your code is stored inside the library file, so that any program using your library can locate the desired function and execute it.
Each register has a specific name called ABI name which access the internal registers of internal registers.

Labwork
Write C code in one file and your assembly code in a separate file. In the assembly file, we declared assembly functions with appropriate signatures that match the calling conventions of your platform.
C Program - Sum of numbers from 1 to 9:

Compilation: To compile C code and Asseembly file use the command
riscv64-unknown-elf-gcc -O1 -mabi=lp64 -march=rv64i -o p3.o p3.c load.s this would generate object file p3.o

# DAY 1 RTL DESIGN USING VERILOG WITH SKY130 TECHNOLOGY

## **Introduction to open-source simulator iverilog**
__Simulator__
   + simulator is a tool used for checking the design
   
   + RTL design is checked for adherence to the spec by simulating the design
   
   + Simulator is a tool used for simulating the design(iverilog is the simulator here)
   
__Design__
   + Design is the actual verilog code or set of verilog codes which has the intended functionality to meet with required specifications
   
__Testbench__
     + Testbench is the setup to apply stimulus(test_vectors) to the design to check it's functionality and match it to spec
     
__How Simulator Works?__
   + Simulator looks for the change on input signals
   + Upon change to the input the output will be evaluated,no change in input-no change in output
   + Simulator is looking for change in the values of input.

**we have stimulus generator,we dont have stimulus observer,we arre directly dumping the vcd file and observing the output.**

+ The set of primary inputs/primary outputs will remain same between RTL design and synthesized netlist

**RTL design:**

Behavioural representation of required specification

**Synthesis:**

 It is RTL to gate level translation,this file is given out as a file called netlist
 
**.lib**

.lib is a collection of logical modules,there are different flavours of same gate.

-->We reqire different flavours of the same gate for example a 2 input AND gate with slow,medium and faster version.
In general fast version of gates are required for maximum speed of operation of a digital circuit, and slow version of gates are required to 
ensure no "hold" issues.This collection of logical modules form .lib

![WhatsApp Image 2023-09-02 at 17 41 52](https://github.com/pavithra7369/asic/assets/143084423/1bab7205-351f-48d9-85ec-84f70c8a9a4e)

**-->Faster cells vs Slower cell**, faster calls require more silicon area and power but they have less delay, slower cells require less silicon area and power but delay is comparitively more. Faster cells have wider transistors when compared to slower cells.

**-->Selection of cell**
We'll need to guide the Synthesizer to choose the flavour of cells that is optimum for implementation of logic circuit.More use of faster cells leads to more power consumption and silicon area and hold time violations may occur. More use of slower cells may make the circuit sluggish and may not meet the required performance.
So, the guidance offfered to synthesizer is "constraints"

->Reasons for using submodules
+ sub module level synthesis is used when we have multiple instance of same module

+ divide and conquer

  # **Various flop coding styles and optimization**
   + flip flops are sequencing elements, they distinguish the current token from the prrevious token or data,without flip flops the next token might catch up with previous token,garbling both. Thus flip flops are used to store the value of glitches.
   +  flip flops are edge triggered the output of the flop changes only on the edge of the clock,means if the input is glitching the output will be stable,meaning the stable output is given next combinational circuit then the output of the combinational circuit will also be stable.

** How to code the flip flops **
To initialize the flop ,there are control pins on the flop like reset or set

these reset and set can either be synchronous or asynchronous

+ **ASYNCHRONOUS**
> **asynchronous reset**:

    module dff_asyncres ( input clk ,  input async_reset , input d , output reg q );
    always @ (posedge clk , posedge async_reset)
    begin
	      if(async_reset)
		    q <= 1'b0;
	      else	
		     q <= d;
    end
    endmodule

 > **asynchronous set:**

    module module dff_syncres ( input clk , input async_reset , input sync_reset , input d , output reg q );
         always @ (posedge clk )
         begin
	           if (sync_reset)
		         q <= 1'b0;
	           else	
		         q <= d;
         end
         endmodule
